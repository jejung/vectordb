# vectordb

`vectordb` is a high-performance distributed database focused on vector searches using Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN) combined with support for filters, text search, and flexible document storage. Inspired by systems like Elasticsearch, but with a focus on high-dimensional vectors and scalability.

## Goals

- **Schema-free**: No need to define schemas in advance.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) Search**: Supports HSNW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) for vector searches.
- **Flexible Search**: Combines filters, text search, and vector search.
- **On-the-fly Operations**: Insert, remove, and update documents in real-time.
- **Bulk Operations**: Supports bulk operations for greater efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Can be deployed in configurations ranging from singletons to elastic clusters.

## Technologies

- **Language**: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- **Communication Protocol**: TCP/Sockets (with potential future support for UDP)
- **Serialization**: [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/) (for low latency communication, faster parsing)
- **Vector Search Algorithm**: HSNW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World)

## Performance and Scalability Goals

- **Storage**: Support for billions of documents, totaling up to terabytes of data.
- **Latency**: Low latency for specific operations (insert, remove, update). Tolerates up to 30 seconds of latency for indexing.
- **Vectors**: Support for vectors as big as 4096 dimensions.
